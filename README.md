# python-empty-project
An empty Python project with a folder structure and some common modules. You can copy it
and start your new project from there.

This project is pre-configured to work with Pytest, Flake8, Autopep8 and Mypy. If you want to
use an autoformatter, you can install `autopep8` and run if from the command line as follows:

`autopep8 myproject --recursive --in-place -a -a -a`
